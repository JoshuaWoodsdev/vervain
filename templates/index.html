            <h2>What is Vervain?</h2>
            <p>
                Vervain started as a simple idea: to make building apps on Kadena easier for everyone. It’s a homegrown
                toolkit designed to give you the basics you need to get started with Kadena today, while leaving plenty
                of room to grow into something bigger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, Vervain focuses on connecting your web apps to Kadena with simple tools to handle blockchain
                basics. As the toolkit evolves, it’ll bring even more features to make your projects smoother, faster,
                and more powerful.
